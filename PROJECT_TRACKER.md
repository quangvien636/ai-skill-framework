# AI Skill Framework - Project Tracker

Version: 0.21
Status: Active
Last updated: 2026-07-05

## Purpose

Track the repository-backed delivery state of the AI Skill Framework. A task is
complete only when its durable output exists in the repository and satisfies the
project's definition of done.

## Current Sprint

**Sprint 21 - Semantic Validator Core**

Goal: implement deterministic semantic rules over typed IR before beginning
repository-wide discovery.

Status: **Completed**

### Sprint 21 Backlog

| Item | Status | Evidence / Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Validate unique metric names and total weight | Done | `ASF-SEMANTIC-001..002` |
| Validate Evaluation/Reflection routing and gates | Done | `ASF-SEMANTIC-003..004` |
| Validate Workflow mapping targets, sources, and declared types | Done | `ASF-SEMANTIC-005..007` |
| Validate retry routing and entrypoint reachability | Done | `ASF-SEMANTIC-008..009` |
| Add offline semantic conformance runner | Done | `scripts/build_semantics.py`; 3/3 cases |
| Preserve IR and graph layer boundaries | Done | Semantic core consumes IR and does not rediscover files or graph edges |

### Sprint 21 Exit Criteria

- `python scripts/validate_contracts.py` passes 16/16.
- `python scripts/build_ir.py` passes 40/40, including every production Review
  Quality artifact.
- `python scripts/build_graph.py` passes 13/13, including the production package
  with all required Knowledge and Skill references.
- `python scripts/build_semantics.py` passes 3/3.
- `python -m unittest discover` passes all 68 tests.
- No parser, schema, or graph rule is weakened or duplicated.
- Repository Markdown links and ADR references remain valid.

### Sprint 21 Deferred / Documented Gaps

- Canonical Skill and Knowledge ID/path agreement requires Phase 4 Repository
  Discovery and remains next.
- Type compatibility is exact declared-type equality; no coercion or structural
  object subtyping is defined by current specifications.
- One-responsibility assessment remains human review until an objective rule is
  specified.
- Semantic validation consumes explicit IR results and is not yet wired through
  a unified repository validation command.

## Sprint History

Full per-sprint backlogs and exit criteria for completed sprints live in Git
history and the ADRs/architecture documents each sprint produced; this table
is the durable summary so this tracker does not grow one repeated section per
sprint indefinitely.

| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Foundation | Repository governance, System Architecture, Design Principles, ADR-0001 |

| 17 | Validator Roadmap Phase 3 (Dependency/Version Graph) | `dependency_graph.py`, `version_graph.py`, `scripts/build_graph.py` (10/10), 53 unit tests, ADR-0010 |
| 18 | Content Creation Skill v1 | Active Skill, five Knowledge documents, end-to-end Workflow, production graph scenario |
| 19 | Research Skill v1 | Active Skill, six methodology documents, topic-to-brief Workflow, production graph scenario |
| 20 | Review Quality Skill v1 | Active Skill, seven quality documents, draft-to-reviewed-package Workflow, production graph scenario |
| 21 | Semantic Validator Core | Nine IR-level semantic rules, conformance runner, structured diagnostics |

## Risks and Guardrails

| Risk | Guardrail |
| --- | --- |
| Context becomes trapped in conversations | Record durable context in the repository |
| Master Skill becomes a giant prompt | Keep it limited to orchestration |
| Skills overlap and become hard to test | Enforce One Skill = One Responsibility |
| Knowledge is duplicated in prompts | Store reusable knowledge in the Knowledge Base |
| Implementation drifts from architecture | Update and review documentation first |
| Governance documents (this tracker) grow unbounded | Summarize completed sprints in Sprint History instead of repeating sections |

## Next Actions

1. Begin Phase 4: extend validation from an explicit fixture list
   to a real repository-wide scan (Project Discovery, `CLI_ARCHITECTURE.md`),
   plus canonical ID/path, Knowledge Index, and package-structure validation.
2. When a CLI implementation sprint starts, choose and record its language
   and package layout in a new ADR that conforms to `CLI_ARCHITECTURE.md`,
   and wire `scripts/build_ir.py`/`scripts/build_graph.py`'s pipelines
   behind the `validate`/`generate` commands per `CLI_ARCHITECTURE.md`'s
   Validator/Generator Integration.
3. Add a lightweight link/anchor check to the fixture-conformance scripts
   (or a sibling script) so Sprint 14's manual broken-link scan does not
   need to be repeated by hand every sprint — an Automation Engineer task
   per `.ai/roles/AUTOMATION_ENGINEER.md`.
4. Consider whether `.ai/governance/DECISION_RIGHTS.md`'s ADR-acceptance
   convention needs a lighter-weight mechanical check (e.g., an ADR
   "Status" field the validator confirms is one of the allowed values).
5. Add precise line/column source-position tracking to IR adapter
   diagnostics (currently field/section names only) — Sprint 16's
   Deferred / Documented Gap, still open.
6. If pre-release versions are ever adopted, implement full SemVer
   pre-release precedence in `version_ir.py` (Sprint 17's documented
   simplification).
