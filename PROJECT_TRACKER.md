# AI Skill Framework - Project Tracker

Version: 0.23
Status: Active
Last updated: 2026-07-05

## Purpose

Track the repository-backed delivery state of the AI Skill Framework. A task is
complete only when its durable output exists in the repository and satisfies the
project's definition of done.

## Current Sprint

**Sprint 23 - Runtime Planning Foundation**

Goal: prepare immutable Runtime models, dependency resolution, and deterministic
Workflow planning without implementing execution.

Status: **Completed**

### Sprint 23 Backlog

| Item | Status | Evidence / Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Build immutable execution context and plan models | Done | `asf_runtime/models.py` |
| Load a Runtime catalog from shared IR | Done | `asf_runtime/catalog.py`; 24 artifacts |
| Resolve exact active Workflow, Skill, and Knowledge versions | Done | Shared Version IR range semantics |
| Produce deterministic topological order and ready batches | Done | `asf_runtime/planner.py` |
| Define tool-neutral pipeline interfaces | Done | `asf_runtime/interfaces.py` |
| Record planning-before-execution boundary | Done | Runtime Architecture; ADR-0011 |

### Sprint 23 Exit Criteria

- `python scripts/validate_contracts.py` passes 16/16.
- `python scripts/build_ir.py` passes 40/40, including every production Review
  Quality artifact.
- `python scripts/build_graph.py` passes 13/13, including the production package
  with all required Knowledge and Skill references.
- `python scripts/build_semantics.py` passes 3/3.
- `python scripts/validate_repository.py` reports zero errors and warnings.
- `python -m unittest discover` passes all 96 tests.
- Production Workflows plan with exact dependency versions and no executor,
  provider, tool, connector, or side effect is introduced.
- Repository Markdown links and ADR references remain valid.

### Sprint 23 Deferred / Documented Gaps

- No Skill/LLM/tool/connector executor, retry loop, state machine, or persistence.
- Runtime input validation checks declared top-level types and presence only;
  complete field constraints and output boundaries remain future work.
- Optional-step, Reflection, manual-review, failure-record, and resume behavior
  is not executed.
- Runtime and Tool declarations remain non-graph references until schemas and IR
  adapters exist.

## Sprint History

Full per-sprint backlogs and exit criteria for completed sprints live in Git
history and the ADRs/architecture documents each sprint produced; this table
is the durable summary so this tracker does not grow one repeated section per
sprint indefinitely.

## Risks and Guardrails

| Risk | Guardrail |
| --- | --- |
| Context becomes trapped in conversations | Record durable context in the repository |
| Master Skill becomes a giant prompt | Keep it limited to orchestration |
| Skills overlap and become hard to test | Enforce One Skill = One Responsibility |
| Knowledge is duplicated in prompts | Store reusable knowledge in the Knowledge Base |
| Implementation drifts from architecture | Update and review documentation first |
| Governance documents (this tracker) grow unbounded | Summarize completed sprints in Sprint History instead of repeating sections |

## Next Actions

1. Finish bounded Phase 4 rules: automate Markdown link/anchor validation and
   define secret/lifecycle policy before enforcement.
2. Design Tool/Connector contracts and interfaces without external execution,
   including LLM, browser, search, filesystem, MCP, and connector capability
   boundaries.
3. Extend Runtime planning with explicit state/failure models and full boundary
   value validation before implementing any executor.
4. When a CLI implementation sprint starts, choose and record its language
   and package layout in a new ADR that conforms to `CLI_ARCHITECTURE.md`,
   and wire `scripts/build_ir.py`/`scripts/build_graph.py`'s pipelines
   behind the `validate`/`generate` commands per `CLI_ARCHITECTURE.md`'s
   Validator/Generator Integration.
5. Add a lightweight link/anchor check to the fixture-conformance scripts
   (or a sibling script) so Sprint 14's manual broken-link scan does not
   need to be repeated by hand every sprint — an Automation Engineer task
   per `.ai/roles/AUTOMATION_ENGINEER.md`.
6. Consider whether `.ai/governance/DECISION_RIGHTS.md`'s ADR-acceptance
   convention needs a lighter-weight mechanical check (e.g., an ADR
   "Status" field the validator confirms is one of the allowed values).
7. Add precise line/column source-position tracking to IR adapter
   diagnostics (currently field/section names only) — Sprint 16's
   Deferred / Documented Gap, still open.
8. If pre-release versions are ever adopted, implement full SemVer
   pre-release precedence in `version_ir.py` (Sprint 17's documented
   simplification).
